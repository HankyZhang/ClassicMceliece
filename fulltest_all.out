Classic McEliece Implementation
================================

=== Running Comprehensive Test Suite ===

1. Basic McEliece Test:
Testing Classic McEliece implementation...
Generating key pair...
[keygen] attempt 1/10...
Key generation successful!
Testing encapsulation...
Encapsulation successful!
Testing decapsulation...
Debug: Decoding failed, using backup vector s
Decapsulation failed! Session keys don't match.
Debug: First 16 bytes of session key 1: 3e32d1e0feab2a59c60b1228d78c6818
Debug: First 16 bytes of session key 2: 5352031b0f193539e3a754723729a0db
Test completed.

2. Multiple Round Test (5 iterations):
  Round 1: [keygen] attempt 1/10...
Debug: Decoding failed, using backup vector s
FAILED (key mismatch)
  Round 2: [keygen] attempt 1/10...
Debug: Decoding failed, using backup vector s
FAILED (key mismatch)
  Round 3: [keygen] attempt 1/10...
Debug: Decoding failed, using backup vector s
FAILED (key mismatch)
  Round 4: [keygen] attempt 1/10...
Debug: Decoding failed, using backup vector s
FAILED (key mismatch)
  Round 5: [keygen] attempt 1/10...
Debug: Decoding failed, using backup vector s
FAILED (key mismatch)
  Success rate: 0/5 (0.0%)

3. Parameter Verification:
  m = 13 (field extension degree)
  n = 6688 (code length)
  t = 128 (error correction capability)
  k = 5024 (code dimension)
  q = 8192 (field size)
  Expected: k = n - m*t = 6688 - 13*128 = 5024
  ✓ Parameter consistency check PASSED
